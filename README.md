# Tandem-for-400-Trivia-App

This app is meant to be used in a web browser, Chrome is recommended 

HOW-TO-USE
Due to the process of fetching data from a JSON file, this app must either be hosted on a server or opened through a local host.
Personally recommended localhost method:
- Download and install XAAMP for your appropriate OS (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
- Using your file browser navigate into a folder titled "htcdocs" within your xaamp folder
- Place app into a new folder within htdocs and name it "QuizApp"
- Open XAAMP
- Click Start under Actions for the Apache Module
- Open Chrome, or other supported web broswer
- In the address bar, type "localhost/QuizApp"
If these steps are followed, and the Apache server is running correctly, the contents of the app should be visible in your browser.

Thank you for downloading my app!
